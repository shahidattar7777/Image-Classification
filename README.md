# Image-Classification
Classification of Merchandise using Convolutional Neural Networks with Pytorch and CUDA.

In this project I was able to create a 2 layered Convolutional Neural Network to classify different merchandise in Fashion MNIST Database using Pytorch.

I was able to get a 93.51% accuracy on my model.
